OUTLINE
=======

This project includes the files for running a database server to manage data from 
preparations of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG). It manages user accounts for uploading
of data (anyone can download). It includes privileges for an administrator account
that can activate users for uploads, delete users, and manage all experiments. Users
can enter experiments, which are defined first by metadata. Then they enter processed
data (such as frequency and phase relationships) for a baseline condition. Following 
this users can add more conditions and associated processed data. Users can also upload 
files to associate with these experiments.


REQUIREMENTS
============

This code is written for Python 2.7, and depends on several python modules. Those most
likely to need installation include pandas, Flask, Flask-Login, and WTForms.   


GETTING THE SERVER RUNNING
==========================

The project should run straight away as currently distributed, once all the appropriate
modules are in place in python. It depends on finding the following:

- A config.json file in the main directory, described below
- Directory specified for file uploads in config.json must exit (/files by default)
- A /databases subdirectory must exist and include: user_database.json, containing user
information; user_pdatabase.json, containing hashed user password information for logins;
processed_data.json, containing processed data for all conditions; and metadata.json, 
containing metadata for all entered experiments. Base forms of these files are included
in this distribution in /Database-seeds
- A /static subdirectory including the image file crabs.jpg
- A /templates subdirectory containing all the .html templates used to serve webpages

All these files should be in the basic distribution on github.

When ready, start the server from the terminal by running (in Linux or OSX terminal):

**sudo python app.py**

This must be run as sudo, or the server will not be able to create and remove directories,
or save uploaded files. It will crash in this case.


ACCESSING DATA
==============

Uploaded and entered data can be freely downloaded by anyone. To do so follow a link 
(for example from the home page) to the download page. From here you can download 
metadata and processed data as .csv and uploaded files for any experiment. See details
below under "downloading data".

This readme file is available for download as well from a link on the home page.

WORKFLOW FOR EXPERIMENTERS
==========================

To include your data in the STG database, you will first need to create an account on the
server. This can be done by the "Create new account" link on the homepage. Following this,
your account will need to be activated for uploads by the administrator before you are
allowed to upload files or enter new experiments. Email the administrator to ask for this
activation; a link to send the administrator an email is on the homepage. (Note: the 
server stores your password in hashed form (unsalted SHA256))

Once you have followed this procedure and have an activated account, you can log in and 
enter experiments. Basic details about accounts such as user info and password can be
edited by following links from the home page once signed in.

Remember to sign-out from the home page when finished! Currently there is no auto-sign-out
functionality.


Entering a new experiment
-------------------------

From the homepage, click on the "My Experiments Page" link. This takes you to a page that
shows the metadata for all the experiments you have entered so far. At the top,
click "Enter a new experiment".

This page initially shows you a table of metadata for all of your entered experiments. When
you first arrive here, this will be empty, so creating a new experiment is your first step.

You will next be prompted to enter metadata for the experiment including a name (such as 
lab notebook page), experiment date, species and saline information, lab, as well as a
free-form space for entering notes about your experiment. The only required field here is 
experiment date, but please enter all data that are available.

Following this you are taken to a page of checkboxes for more information about what
types of experiment you are entering. You can select what nerves were recorded from 
extracellularly, and what neurons you recorded from intracellularly. You can also set
flags for types of experiments (like decentralization) that will be includes in metadata
files and can be searched offline after downloading the database. This can help users
find the files from experiments they are interested in. After this is complete you click
to save your new experiment.

After submitting you will be taken to the experiment page.


Experiment page
---------------

The next step is to enter processed data for a "baseline" condition. A blank version of
a baseline condition will be created for you. The baseline condition can never be deleted.
**PLEASE MAKE SURE BASELINE DATA ARE FROM A FRONT-END ON, UNMANIPULATED PREP!** Other 
conditions should be entered as new conditions. 

This page first shows you a list of all the conditions of your experiment. Upon creating 
a new experiment, this will include only baseline data. If you also have processed data
from another condition (such as after decentralization, or in the presence of a drug),
enter this by clicking on the link for "new condition" in "More options". This will take
you to a page to enter a new set of processed data that will be associated with this 
condition.

There are no required fields for processed data; there are more fields for processed data
than you will need for any particular experiment. Three blank decimal fields are also 
provided. If these are used they should be described in notes on the metadata page. 


Uploading files
---------------

The experiment page shows you a list of all uploaded files for this experiment. You may
delete or upload a new file by following the links under "More options". Please note, 
there is a maximum filesize (100 MB by default), a maximum number of files per experiment
(15 by default), and a set of allowed file extensions. These parameters can be changed
by editing the config.json file.

When uploading files you are shown a read_me file that can be edited either before 
uploading your file, or later following a link from the experiment page. 

** There is one read_me file for each experiment, that you should edit as you upload
files to describe them. This read_me will be packaged in a zip file with the uploaded
files from your experiment when downloaded. **

Please add information about your uploaded files (such as what conditions they apply to, 
and what nerves or neurons are on what channels, etc.) to the read me file by using
this forms. You can also edit the read_me file straight from a link on the experiment page.

Feel free to upload more detailed .txt files or .pdf files describing your experiment 
in detail. The read_me file is just so a user can make sense of the files after download.
Check out some of the previously uploaded experiments (download their uploaded files)
to see how this works.


Editing and deleting conditions
-------------------------------

You can edit or delete previously entered condition processed data by entering a
condition: enter its index (leftmost column of the html table), choose your option
from the dropdown "Action" button, and click "Act on condition".


Editing and deleting experiments and metadata
---------------------------------------------

To delete or edit a previously entered experiment, select the experiment by entering its
index (on the experiments page), choose the appropriate option from the "Action" dropdown,
and click "Act on experiment". The "Edit / Upload Data (conditions and files)" option will
take you to the experiment page as described above. You can also edit metadata by 
following a link from the experiment page.


DOWNLOADING DATA
================

No log-in is required to download metadata, processed data, or uploaded files. These 
options can be found by following a link for the "Download Page", for example from the
home page.


Metadata and processed data for all conditions
----------------------------------------------

These can be viewed or downloaded as .json or .csv files. For metadata, there is also an
option to download without the "Notes" field. This field allows large text inputs and 
may make .csv files unwieldy. These are shown sorted by experiment date. Searching 
functions aren't available here -- download the dataset and do the analysis offline.


Uploaded files
--------------

Following this link first prompts the user to select an experiment by metadata. It then
displays a list of uploaded files associated with this experiment, which may be selected
and downloaded together as a zip file by clicking the download button.


ADMINISTRATOR FUNCTIONS
=======================

Someone will hopefully always be in charge of administrating the project. At a minimum,
admin duties involve activating new users for uploads, keeping the server up to date,
and regularly backing up the data. If you should find the STG database running without
any responsible attendant party, please disconnect it, before it gains consciousness.


config.json
-----------

This file can be edited with a text editor (nothing fancy! TextEdit on Mac, for example,
tends to change the " marks to something python will no longer understand). Don't 
disturb the .json formatting. The parameters are:

- "FilePath" : This specifies the path where uploaded files are stored. Must exist!
- "AllowedFiletypes" : The extensions that are allowable for user file uploads
- "MaxUsers" : This is the maximum number of allowed user accounts that can be created.
- "MaxFilesizeMB" : Maximum allowed filesize for uploaded files, in megabytes
- "MaxFiles" : The maximum number of files that may be uploaded per experiment
- "MaxUserExperiments" : Maximum number of experiments that may be created by one user
- "UploadsAllowed" : 1 allows uploads, anything else disables all uploads
- "DownloadsAllowed" : 1 allows downloads, anything else disables all downloads
- "EditsAllowed" : 1 allows editing, anything else disables all editing


Checkboxes for metadata
-----------------------

These can easily be added to. Open the python file app.py and you can find where these 
are defined, near line 50. Adding checkboxes to this list will work fine and nothing will
break. Deleting or editing existing labels however, will be a problem if any experiments
use these labels in their metadata. 


Admin server account
--------------------

This account is named "Admin". It must exist and the server itself will not allow it to be
deleted. Logging in as Admin grants full privileges over all uploaded experiments 
including editing, deleting, and uploading files and metadata. It also allows access to
the Admin page (from a link on the home page).


Admin page
----------

From here user accounts can be edited, activated and deactivated for uploads, and deleted.
The admin may also reset the password for any user, whereupon the server generates a 
new random password. This password must be manually supplied to the user! The server
will not send an email to the user with this password. The Admin should email this 
password to the user who should then log in and immediately change it.

Note: Deleting a user does not delete the user's uploaded experiments. At present, if you
want to delete all of a user's experiments, it must be done one by one from the 
experiments page. Admin can do this. One may also write a script to remove them from
the .json file processed_data.json, but be careful not to screw up the file! Simply
removing the entries with keys containing the deleted username will not upset anything
if done properly.

Remember to sign-out from the home page when finished! Currently there is no auto-sign-out
functionality.


password_tool.py
----------------

This is a simple script that resets the Admin password, if it is ever forgotten. Run it
from the terminal in the main project directory by $ python password_tool.py
